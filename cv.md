## About Me:
I am 31 years old. I am an engineer-adjuster of relay protection and automation devices. I graduated from the Energy faculty of BNTU

I liked my profession, I had to constantly develop in it, read technical documentation, program terminals, write logic, check and look for hardware defects. You can see the fruits of my work in the uninterrupted power supply of your homes, apartments. This is the result of setting up complex mechanisms, terminals and automation.

I am such a person thats if you ask a question to which I do not know the answer, I will say that I do not know, but I will do everything to understand and find out the answer to it. And I think that this quality will give me the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and master a new profession for myself as a front-end developer.

## Skills:
+ HTML5, CSS.
+ Git, GitHub.
+ VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
+ AutoCAD Electrical, CorelDRAW, Adobe Photoshop, 
  Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Lightroom Classic.

## Code Example:

}

  it("fixed tests", () => {
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(1,1), 1);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,1), 2);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,2), 4);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(3,5), 15);
